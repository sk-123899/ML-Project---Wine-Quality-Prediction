# Abstract
Wine classification is a difficult task since taste is the least understood of the human senses. A good wine quality prediction can be very useful in the certification phase, since currently the sensory analysis is performed by human tasters, being clearly a subjective approach. An automatic predictive system can be integrated into a decision support system, helping the speed and quality of the performance. Furthermore, a feature selection process can help to analyze the impact of the analytical tests. If it is concluded that several input variables are highly relevant to predict the wine quality, since in the production process some variables can be controlled, this information can be used to improve the wine quality. Classification models used here are 
Random Forest ,SVC , Correlation , Heatmap Etc.

# Problem Statement
Predicting wine Quality and Differentiate into good and bad Quality wine.

# Proposed Methodology
1) Data Collection of Red Wine from public datasets. 
2) Data preparation for building model. 
3) Feature selection 
4) Implementing machine learning techniques 
5) Comparison of performance. 
6) Interpretation of results

# Algorithms Implemented

# SVM
SVM is a supervised machine learning algorithm that is commonly used for classification and regression challenges. In the SVM algorithm, each point is represented as a data item within the n-dimensional space where the value of each feature is the value of a specific coordinate. After plotting, classification has been performed by finding hyper-plane, which differentiates two classes.
Accuracy achieved :- 87%

# Random Forest  
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression problems in ML. Random forests creates decision trees on randomly selected data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the best solution by means of voting. It also provides a pretty good indicator of the feature importance.
Accuracy achieved :- 90%

# Decision Tree  
A decision tree is a map of the possible outcomes of a series of related choices. It allows an individual or organization to weigh possible actions against one another based on their costs, probabilities, and benefits. 
Accuracy achieved :- 88.5%

# Accuracy Comparision of above 3 algorithms
